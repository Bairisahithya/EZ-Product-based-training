difference between recursion and backtracking
__________________________________________________
Recursion:
---------
â€¢Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science.
It involves a function repeatedly calling itself until a base case is reached. Recursion is used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar sub-problems.
It can significantly reduce code length and complexity compared to iteration. Recursion is an optimal approach for tasks like tree and graph traversals and finding the Greatest
Common Divisor (GCD) using Euclid's algorithm.
Backtracking:
------------
Backtracking is a technique for finding solutions to problems through recursive exploration.
It involves undoing recursive changes if certain conditions are not met and discarding less optimal solutions.
Backtracking is more efficient than brute force in solving complex problems, although it can have exponential time complexity.
It excels in solving challenging problems like the N-Queens problem and the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP).
*It explores various choices and systematically backtracks when necessary to arrive at the best solution.
